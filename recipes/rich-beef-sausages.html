<p><h4>Sausage? I hardly know her!</h4></p>
<p>Sausages have been around for at least 20 years, however cutting edge research suggests this may be as long as 23!  You can't spell 'feed' without 3 of the letters found in 'Rich Beef Sausages'! And if that's good enough for me, you better believe it is good enough for you!</p>
